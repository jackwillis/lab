Several types of straw mulch including, rye, wheat, oats, and barley are effective and genrally are available in the Great Lakes area. Straw mulches are available in late summer from area farmers. Straw used for mulch in the garden should be clean and free of weed plants and seed. A visual inspection of a straw bale can give a good indication of the straw quality. Break open a bale of straw and examine it. The bale should only contain stems and leaves of the grain plant. The presence of broadleaf or grass plants indicate that the straw is contaminated with weed seed and should not be used. Organic mulches break down over time and become a valuable source of organic matter for the garden soil.</p></foreignObject></svg>
